Queries are fetched from QS and executed by Plug-ins on the aggregated\r\nNetFlow data of organizations. As a result of these executions, NfSen Plug-in find the flow data which includes \r\nthe related threat or attack information. After the detection, Plug-in alerts the QS automatically regarding the \r\nfindings of the applied query.\r\n\r\nBy collecting and interpreting attack statistics from each Plug-in, NfQuery creates a general overview of the threat\r\ntrends seen in the multi-domain network. Finally, by utilizing the alerting system of NfSen, NfQuery becomes a threat\r\ndetection and security alerting system for multi-domain networks.\r\n\r\nComponents\r\n---------------\r\na. Query Server (QS)\r\nQuery Server (QS) is placed in the center of the system and establishes the connection between all components. QS \r\nis composed of three sub-elements; Query Manager (QM), Query Generator (QG) and Query Repository (QR). \r\n\r\nb. NfQuery Plug-in\r\nThe NfQuery Plug-in is installed at each domain side over the NfSen instance at the domain and communicates with QS\r\nto perform the administratorâ€™s requests such as fetching new queries, updating query list, getting/sending statistical\r\nreports and executing the queries over the flow data. \r\n\r\nc. Sources\r\nNfQuery sources are the main components that provide threat information. This includes publicly available resources\r\nsuch as Botnet C&C server lists (Amada SpyEye), DNS blacklists (DShield), malicious domains and phishing sites lists\r\nor output of security analysis applications such as Honeypots, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Intrusion Prevention\r\nSystems (IPS) or Firewalls which may provide data in means of log files for private use in NfQuery framework.\r\n\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n============\r\nPlease see the file called plugin/INSTALL for plugin dependecies.\r\nPlease see the file called queryserver/INSTALL for queryserver dependecies.\r\n\r\nThe Latest Version\r\n------------------\r\nDetails of the latest version can be found on the Official NfQuery Web Page.\r\nhttp://nfquery.ulakbim.gov.tr\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\nPlease see http://nfquery.ulakbim.gov.tr/\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nPlease see the file called plugin/INSTALL to install plugin.\r\nPlease see the file called queryserver/INSTALL to install queryserver.\r\n\r\nLicensing\r\n---------\r\nPlease see the file called LICENSE.\r\n\r\nAuthor\r\n======\r\n\r\nAhmet Can Kepenek <ahmetcan.kepenek@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nSerhat Rifat Demircan <demircan.serhat@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nSerdar Yigit <yigit-serdar@yandex.com>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
